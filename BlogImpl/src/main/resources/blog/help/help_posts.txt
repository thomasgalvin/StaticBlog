Static Blog: Writing Posts
==========================

The renderer will look in three different folders for your posts: 
`.../posts/published/`, `.../posts/draft/`, `.../posts/private/`. Published 
posts will always be rendered. Draft and private posts will only be rendered if 
you explicitly ask for it.

Posts can be written in either Markdown or plain HTML. The renderer will look 
for files that end in `.md`, `.html`, and `.htm`.

Post Metadata
-------------

YAML-formated metadata should be included at the front of a blog post. The metadata must be fenced in with three hyphens at the front and end, like this:



---

Pull quotes and pagination
--------------------------

By default, the entire post will appear on the landing and/or history pages. If 
you want to only show content "above the fold" on these pages, you can use the 
`<!--pullquote-->` markup to indicate where the front-page content ends. You can 
also paginate your posts, using the `<!--more-->` markup. For example:



---
title: Post Title
subtitle: This is a great post
author: thomas
tags:
    - Tag One
    - Tag Two
    - Tag Three
date: 2016-04-07
---
This content will appear on the front page.
<!--pullquote-->
And this content will only appear when the reader clicks "read more".
<!--more-->
This will only appear when the reader clicks "next page".
<!--more-->
And this content will be on page 4.



This will result in a post with four pages, and only the first page will show up
on link pages.
