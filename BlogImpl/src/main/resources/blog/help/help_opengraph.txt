Static Blog: Social Media Metadata
==================================

OpenGraph is a metadata standard developed by Facebook, which allows authors and 
publishers to control how internet resources appear when they are shared on 
social media. 

Static Blog supports the OpenGraph protocol, allowing you to set the image and
preview text for your blog posts, as well as an array of other information.
We also support the equivalent Google and Twitter metadata formats.

For the most part, you only need to specify OpenGraph metadata, and we will 
copy over relevant information to the Google and Twitter sections. Some 
metadata, however, will need to be set specifically; for example, Twitter's
description is limited to 120 characters, while Facebook and Google do not 
impose such a restriction.

This information should be specified in the YAML section at the top of your blog
posts. 

Additionally, defaults can be set in the `site.yml` file, under `postDefaults`. 
See the `site` section of the help file for more details.
