Static Blog: Serving the site
=============================

This software includes a simple web server, so you can view your generated 
content without publishing it to your web host. To start the server, run 
`blog -server` or `blog -s`. 

The port can be specified with the `-port` option. By default, the web server 
will run on port `8080`.

This can be included with the `generate` and `watch` commands like so: 
`blog -gws`.

When the server is running, you can visit <http://localhost:8080> to see how 
your site will look in the wild.
