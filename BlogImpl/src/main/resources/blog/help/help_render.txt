Static Blog: Rendering the Website
==================================

Rendering refers to the process by which your source files, templates, and 
site metadata are transformed into a complete, standalone, static website.

Generally, this is as simple as executing `blog -g`.

The following command-line options are available:

 -g,--generate              Generate the final static web site
 -w,--watch                 Watch the source dirs for changes and
                            automatically rebuild
 -d,--drafts                Include draft posts when rendering
 -p,--private               Include private posts when rendering
