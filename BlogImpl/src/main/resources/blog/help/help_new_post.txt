Static Blog: Interactive Post Generator
=======================================

This is a tool that allows you to quickly and easily create a blog post, with 
metadata, from the command line.

The following command-line options are available:

Creating a new post:
 
 -n,--new                   Create a new post
 -template <arg>            Load template file for new post
 -empty                     Create a new, empty post
 -k,--simple                Only prompt for the most common post metadata
 -asis                      Create post as-is; do not prompt for metadata
                            when creating a new post

When the interactive generator is started (eg blog -n -k) you will be prompted 
for post metadata, and then asked to confirm those values before the post is 
written to disk.
