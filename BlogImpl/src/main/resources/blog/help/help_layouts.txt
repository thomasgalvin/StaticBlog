Static Blog: Layouts / Themes
=============================

You can define arbitrary layouts in the `src/layouts/` folder. We use Freemarker
(http://freemarker.org/) as our templating engine, and you can read all about 
how to write Freemarker templates here: http://freemarker.org/docs/

When you use `blog -i`, a file called `src/layouts/default.ftl` will be created 
for you, and used to generate any page that doesn't have a different layout 
specified. You can, however, create any kind of layout you want, just by adding 
a file to `layouts` and setting the `layout` property of a post.

If you have a file called `src/layouts/movie-reviews.ftl`, you can use it in a 
post by setting the `layout` attribute to `movie-reviews`.

The following variables are available to the template:

Themes
------

You can implement a new theme by recreating/editing any layouts used by your 
blog and storing them in a separate folder. For example, you could have:

* `.../MyBlog/`
    *         `layouts/`
        *              `theme-one/`
            *                     `default.ftl`
            *                     `splash.ftl`
        *              `theme-two/`
            *                     `default.ftl`
            *                     `splash.ftl`

You could then switch between themes by changing the value of `layouts` in 
`config.yml` from `layouts/theme-one` to `layouts/theme-two`.
