Static Blog configuration
=========================

The file .../data/config.yml contains options that control the behavior of the 
renderer. The most important option is the location of the 'pandoc' executable.

By default, the renderer will use a configuration that expects a directory 
structure identical to the one generated by blog --init, so you probably won't 
have to change many options here.
